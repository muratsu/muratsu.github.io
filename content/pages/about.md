![about-me](/media/about-me.jpg)

I am an ex-Microsoft developer, [IEEE paper co-author](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5136438/) and [baby diaper inventor](http://gazetesu.sabanciuniv.edu/tr/protcare-nur-karatoprak-murat-sutunc-sabanci-univ). As a passionate entrepreneur, I write code to flatten the world and to automate unpleasant processes.

I love coding and reading about business strategy. [Priceonomics](https://priceonomics.com/), [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), and [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/) are just amazing blogs. I also highly recommend anyone to watch [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt), [The School of Life](https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel) and [Y Combinator](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcefcZRL2oaA_uBNeo5UOWg) youtube channels.

My name is Murat Sutunc.

I'm currently exploring ideas around crafting software and products using AI. We're headed toward a world where anyone can build whatever they imagine. I'm interested in how we can help make that happen.

I made my first dollar on the internet in 2004 by selling an MMO game server to a local internet café. Since then, I've worked at various startups and companies, from teams of 2 to teams of 100+.

My first "real job" was at Microsoft, where I worked on Visual Studio, focusing on programming languages and developer productivity. I was part of the founding team that built the [TypeScript language](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I also worked on [Chakra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra_(JavaScript_engine)) (Microsoft’s alternative to Google’s V8) and [Apache Cordova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cordova).

After Microsoft, I founded a startup called Codela. Frustrated by my own experiences interviewing with tech companies, I built a platform to help companies hire software developers more transparently. We got more than half of the top 10 tech companies in Turkey to use our platform, but we couldn’t grow it into a venture-scale business.

Most recently, I worked at [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) as an engineering manager. We focused on extending Sourcegraph beyond the website—making it available on every platform (browser extensions, IDE extensions, you name it). We launched more products than I can count, it was a blast.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing video games (mostly ARPGs and competitive FPS), running, and culinary experiments. Since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by the idea of a digital world where we can create anything we want. Movies like *Tron* and *The Matrix* have had a big influence on me. I'm excited about the future of AI and how it will change the world.

Hope to see you around!

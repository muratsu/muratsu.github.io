My name is Murat Sutunc.

I'm currently exploring ideas around crafting software and products using AI. We're headed towards a world where everyone will be able to build whatever they imagine. I'm interested in how we can make this happen.

I made my first dollar on the internet in 2004 by selling a MMO game server to a local internet caf√©. Since then, I've worked at various startups and companies, from a small team of 2 to a team of 100+.

My first "real job" was at Microsoft. At Microsoft, I worked on Visual Studio focusing on programming languages and developer productivity. I was part of the founding team that built the [TypeScript language](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Besides that, I've worked at [Chakra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra_(JavaScript_engine)) (Microsoft's alternative to Google's V8) and [Apache Cordova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cordova). 

After Microsoft, I've founded a startup called Codela. Frustrated by my own experiences with interviewing with tech companies, I built a platform to help companies hire software developers more transparently. We managed to get more than half of the top 10 tech companies in Turkey to use our platform but couldn't manage to grow it as a venture scale business.

My last job was at [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) as an engineering manager. We worked on extending Sourcegraph beyond the website, making it available on every platform (browser extensions, IDE extensions, you name it). We launched more products than I can count - it was a blast.

Outside of work, I like playing video games (mostly arpgs & competitive fps), running, and culinary experiments. Since I was a kid, I've been interested in the idea of a digital world where we can create whatever we want. The movies, Tron and Matrix have been really influential in my life. I'm excited about the future of AI and how it will change the world.

Hope to see you around!
